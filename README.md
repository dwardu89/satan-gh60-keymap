The keyboard layout can be viewed by navigating to [Keyboard Layouts](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) and pasting the layer in the `Raw` section.

Generate the keymap from [TMK Keymap Generator](https://tkg.io/) or directly from the [tkg Github Repository](https://github.com/kairyu/tkg).

Use the [TKG Toolkit](https://github.com/kairyu/tkg-toolkit) in order to flash the keyboard. Follow the instructions from the README.md file.
